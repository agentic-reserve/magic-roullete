## Original Vulnerability

### Summary
[Brief description of the original finding]

### Location
```
File: [path/to/file.ext]
Line: [LINE_NUMBER]
Function: [function_name]
```

### Code Snippet
```[language]
// Original vulnerable code
```

### Root Cause Analysis
[Explain WHY this vulnerability exists - the underlying pattern or mistake]

### Impact
[What can an attacker achieve by exploiting this?]

---

## Pattern Extraction

### Abstract Pattern
```
SOURCE: [Where does attacker-controlled data enter?]
   ↓
TRANSFORM: [How is data processed?]
   ↓
SINK: [Where does data cause harm?]

MISSING: [What validation/sanitization is absent?]
```

### Search Pattern

**Regex:**
```
[regex pattern]
```

**Semgrep Rule (if applicable):**
```yaml
rules:
  - id: variant-[finding-id]
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          [pattern]
    message: "[message]"
    languages: [[languages]]
    severity: [severity]
```

## Variant Discovery Results

### Search Methodology
1. [Search method 1 - e.g., grep for pattern X]
2. [Search method 2 - e.g., Semgrep rule scan]
3. [Search method 3 - e.g., Manual review of module Y]
