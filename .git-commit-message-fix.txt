fix: Update test-join-game script to use joinGameSol and properly detect full games

## Bug Fixes
- Changed from `joinGame()` to `joinGameSol()` for SOL-based games
- Fixed game full detection logic (was checking non-existent `isFull` field)
- Added proper game mode checking (oneVsOne vs twoVsTwo)
- Script now iterates through all games to find an available one

## Changes
- Use `joinGameSol` instruction instead of `joinGame` (which requires Token-2022 accounts)
- Implement proper full game detection:
  - 1v1: full when teamACount === 1 && teamBCount === 1
  - 2v2: full when teamACount === 2 && teamBCount === 2
- Skip AI games automatically
- Better error messages when no games available

## Test Results
✅ Successfully finds available games
✅ Skips full games
✅ Joins game correctly
✅ Verifies game state updates (team counts, pot, status)
✅ Shows all players in teams

Example output:
- Game 0: Full (Team A: 1, Team B: 1)
- Game 1: Available (Team A: 1, Team B: 0)
- Joined game 1 successfully
- Total pot: 0.2 SOL
- Both teams now have 1 player each
