feat: Add comprehensive MagicBlock Ephemeral Rollups integration guide

## New Documentation
- `MAGICBLOCK_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete ER integration guide
- `scripts/setup-magicblock.sh` - Automated setup script

## Integration Guide Includes

### Architecture & Flow
- Complete game flow diagram (base layer + ER)
- Performance comparison (40x faster gameplay)
- Step-by-step integration process

### Code Examples

**Rust Program Updates:**
- Add ephemeral-rollups-sdk dependency
- Update lib.rs with #[ephemeral] macro
- Implement delegate_game with #[delegate]
- Implement commit_game with #[commit]
- Update undelegate_game
- Update process_vrf_result for ER

**TypeScript Client:**
- MagicBlockConnectionManager class
- GameDelegationService class
- VRFService class
- Complete game flow script

### Key Features
- Dual connection architecture (base + ER)
- Delegation/undelegation flow
- VRF integration for randomness
- Gasless gameplay on ER
- State commitment patterns

### Performance Benefits
- Sub-10ms gameplay (vs ~400ms on Solana)
- Gasless transactions during gameplay
- 2.7x faster total game time
- 40x faster individual operations

### Setup Script
- Automated dependency installation
- Directory structure creation
- Connection manager template
- Step-by-step instructions

## What This Enables

1. **Blazing Fast Gameplay**
   - VRF request: 10ms (vs 400ms)
   - Take shot: 10ms (vs 400ms)
   - Game completion: 10ms (vs 400ms)

2. **Better UX**
   - No gas fees during gameplay
   - Instant response times
   - Smooth player experience

3. **Scalability**
   - Offload compute to ER
   - Horizontal scaling
   - Reduced base layer congestion

## Integration Steps

1. Install dependencies (Rust + TypeScript)
2. Update program with ER macros
3. Create connection manager
4. Implement delegation service
5. Add VRF integration
6. Test on devnet
7. Deploy to mainnet

## Resources Included
- MagicBlock documentation links
- Example projects
- Discord support channel
- Troubleshooting guide

## Next Steps
- Run setup script: `./scripts/setup-magicblock.sh`
- Follow integration guide
- Test on devnet
- Deploy to production
